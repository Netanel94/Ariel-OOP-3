# Weighted Directed Graphs in Python
This project is the fourth assignment given to us in the Object Oriented Programming course in Ariel University.
In this project we'll take a look at a few algorithms concerning Weighted Directed Graphs in Python.

## Implmentation description:


| Class's Name | Description |
|--|--|
|NodeData(sub-class)|this class describes the vertices inside our graph|
|DiGraph|This class respresent our implemantion of a graph using Dictionaries that holdes our vertices and edges|
|GraphAlgo|This class implents several algorithems like shortest path etc....|
